# CultureHub Unity Port

## Overview

This repo contains a port of [this project](https://github.com/mncmncmnc/culturehub_residency) from python/Max MSP to NodeJS/Unity. NodeJS sends microphone input to the Google Speech API and serves the results to a local Unity Project. The Unity Project utilizes the [NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon](http://www.saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm) to color code the words spoken.
